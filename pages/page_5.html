<h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
<br>
ABC Learning Centre  will collect your personal information only if you provide it of your own volition. If you do not want your personal information to be collected, please do not submit it.
We value your privacy. We do not rent or sell your personal information. When you submit your personal details and contact information, you give us explicit consent to call, email, or send SMS to you to confirm participation at the event, workshop and/or to related courses/programmes you are registering to or registered in.

Furthermore, in the course of browsing our site we may automatically track certain information about you. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. Many other websites automatically collect this information.

We only use the information provided through our site to help us improve our services to you, to provide you with the products you have requested, to inform you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you, for marketing purposes and for other internal purposes. ABC Learning Centre  occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending mail and processing event registration. ABC Learning Centre will only provide these companies with the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. Other than what is described, ABC Learning Centre  does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others outside of ABC Learning Centre  and its subsidiaries or parent company, and their advertising and promotional agencies and consultants.

At any time, while accessing our site, you may decline participation in any activity that asks for information (i.e. survey email, or ecommerce).
